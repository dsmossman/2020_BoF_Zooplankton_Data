OPC_DAS Software 216-0411-00 Rev. A

The following additions were made to the software to handle OS-200 data.

	1)  A display window was added to the 'acquire' and 'replay' modes
	    to view the OS200 data as its received.
	2)  The text file output and chart file output were modified to include
	    the string from the OS200.
	3)  An additional strip chart window for displaying OS200 depth and
	    temperature was added in the 'acquire' and 'replay' modes.  This window
	    is accessible by pressing the 'Switch' button.  In order for this function
	    to display properly, the OS200 must be set to the following format:
		
	    date time depth channel1 channel2 temperature salinity channel3 channel4
